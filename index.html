        <br /><br /><b>This is how I make my pictures.</b> <br /><br />This is the first wallpaper I ever made combined with a edited RL logo. <br />Every letter in the wallpaper is entirely made by me using squares and triangles which cost me a
        lot of time. For that reason I always reuse these letters when spelling my name for future projects. I also use them as a signature when it's not used (examples follow). For the background I did the following: first I rendered clouds with
        white and light grey and then I crystalized it (a distort option in paint.net) which gave me this effect.

      <div class="portfolio">
        <img src="Michael wallpaper 3 (website).jpg" style="width: 100%">
        <br /><br />What my idea was for this one is to have a nice galaxy full of stars and colors but when searching for it I found this background which was much nicer than my original idea, I think. What I did next was just simply pasting my
        name
        in it (as usual) and recolored it (original below). I changed it to this color because this way it matches more with the background.
      </div>

      <div class="portfolio">
        <img src="ItsMichaelK wallpaper +RL logo (website).png" style="width: 100%">
        <br /><br />This is the background I use for anything related to gaming. This is my steam username. The spin in the background is similar to the background below.
      </div>

      <div class="portfolio">
        <img src="M wallpaper 1 (website).jpg" style="width: 100%">
        <br /><br />I had a colorful image which I blurred intensifely. I then twisted it and bulged the middle. I made a 'M' and added a shadow.
      </div>

      <div class="portfolio">
        <img src="Michael wallpaper (website).jpg" style="width: 100%">
        <br /><br />This is the image featured on the homepage, without the RL logo. As said there, this is my first ever made wallpaper. Fully made by myself. Everything.
      </div>

      <div class="portfolio">
        <img src="Rocket league road to champion wallpaper (website).jpg" style="width: 100%">
        <br /><br />I made this when I set my goal. My goal was to reach Champion(purple icon on the right), a competitive rank in the game Rocket League, before the year 2019 (I already reached my goal in September 2018). For the background I used
        the same technique as the image above. I made the RL logo on the left side by cutting the insides of the logo in a colorful background. The logo on the right (purple) is a Champion logo I simplified.
      </div>

      <div class="portfolio">
        <img src="Michael wallpaper 2 (website).jpg" style="width: 100%">
        <br /><br />My original idea for this image was to have a cloudy background that overlays the letters. While trying that I ended doing this.

      <div class="portfolio">
        <img src="rocket league wallpaper (website).jpg" style="width: 100%">
        <br /><br />A Rocket League wallpaper. I made it because I needed a background for my PS4.

      <p id="meP">Hi, my name is Michael. I'm a high school student at ds. Pierson College in Den Bosch. As you can see I like to do graphic design in my spare time for own use or even for others. To make these images I use the free software
        paint.net.
        <br /><br />
        As you might have seen in my pictures, I really like playing the game Rocket League. I'm playing in a team and we compete against other teams in a <a href="https://www.unitedrogue.com/" style="text-decoration: none; font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 50, 50);">league</a>.
        Once I become good enough, I want to get into an e-Sports team. But that's still a long way out...</p>
